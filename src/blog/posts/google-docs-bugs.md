### Fix for Google Docs

Our patch is already available for Microsoft Edge browser, and is currently being reviewed by Google.

To fix the issue manually, please open Dark Reader, click **More**, and select **Filter** mode (instead of Filter+),
ensuring **Only for docs.google.com** is selected (otherwise the theme mode will apply to all other websites).

You can learn more about Filter mode [here](https://darkreader.org/blog/filter-mode/).

### Turkish Language Bug

Also, Google Chrome has a bug with the Turkish language in Dark Reader and other extensions.

If you open **chrome://extensions** page and see “Bu uzantı bozuk olabilir” message,
please go to **chrome://settings/languages** and select **English** in Chrome settings.
Select it to use for browser menus (or move up in macOS).
