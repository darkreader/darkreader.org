### Turkish Language Bug


Also, Google Chrome has a bug with the Turkish language in Dark Reader and other extensions. If you open chrome://extensions page and see “Bu uzantı bozuk olabilir” message, please go to chrome://settings/languages and select English in Chrome settings. Select it to use for browser menus (or move up in macOS)


Your support is very important to us. We constantly work on improving Dark Reader.


Best wishes,
The Dark Reader team.
