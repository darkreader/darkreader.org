# Detecting website's dark theme in version 4.9.47

The ongoing development of Dark Reader continues.
We fixed many bugs and made many improvements to Dynamic Mode.
And here is a new interesting feature to try.

### Dark theme detection

We are glad that many websites stopped blinding people with their bright colors.
Dark Reader v4.9.47 can now detect such websites and leave their dark colors untouched.
It works in both the *Dynamic* and the *Filter* modes.

To activate the feature *(and many other interesting features)*,
please [activate v5 design preview](../../tips/activate-v5-preview/) first.
Then go to **Settings**, click **Detect dark theme**.
Now Dark Reader will determine if the website's colors are dark and disable itself there.

The feature is available by default in our [iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dark-reader-for-safari/id1438243180?platform=iphone). Did you know how to activate YouTube's built-in dark mode? [Read it here](../../tips/youtube-dark-mode/).
