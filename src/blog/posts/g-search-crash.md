# How to fix the recent Google Search issue

On August 28-29, Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge released critical updates
(versions 128.0.6613.114 and 128.0.2739.54 respectively)
which addressed security vulnerabilities. 
Unfortunately, we've been receiving unusual bug reports since then.
**While a patch is on the way, hereâ€™s how you can tackle the issue in the meantime**.

### Relationships

Shortly after the problem arose, **we started receiving numerous 1-star ratings**.
Many people have happily used Dark Reader for years, yet this is how they respond.
Not only do **99.9% of users ignore our calls for financial support**.
But some even go further by ruining our rating and placement in the store.
Please remember that there are real people behind the app,
and **such behavior from our users is deeply demotivating**.

The best way to report an issue is by **emailing us with screenshots and steps to reproduce the problem**.
Tech-savvy users can also **report issues on GitHub**.
Thanks to the user who has recorded a video, so that we could finally see where to begin.

Some say that Dark Reader has become worse and slower, but the truth is quite the opposite.
Over the past year, **weâ€™ve implemented massive performance enhancements** and **significant memory optimizations**.
Yet, the web itself is evolving rapidlyâ€”web applications are growing more complex,
standards and frameworks are constantly shifting, and **websites are demanding more and more resources**.

We are relentlessly **refining the app's engine**, making it faster, more reliable, and ready to tackle new challenges.
Meanwhile, our efforts to **enhance theme customization** continue at full speed.
We deliver the best service possible within our budget and often go above and beyondâ€”**working tirelessly**, even on holidays and weekends.

If you ask, **"How can I support such a great service?"** we have an answer. Weâ€™re now offering easy payment options: PayPal and Stripe (for card transactions). If you haven't supported us yet and have been using Dark Reader for a while,
**now is the perfect time for a one-time payment**.

### Google Search problem

</figure>

The problem occurs on the Google Search website and primarily **affects Windows user**.
If your browser **window is small**, you may encounter the "Aw, Snap" error when switching between the Google Search menus.
The Chromium bug has been reported and number [363544341](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/363544341) was assigned.
You can **star the issue to draw more attention from the Chromium developers**.

We have already **made a patch in version 4.9.90** ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
and are currently awaiting manual review from the Google and Microsoft Store teams.

### How to fix the problem

There are several solutions, choose what suits you better.

1. **Simply wait for a few days until the patch arrives**.
Maximize your browser window to avoid triggering the issue.
Check Dark Reader version number at **More**, **All settings**, **About**, **Version**.
The patch should arrive in version 4.9.90.

2. Go to [chrome://flags](chrome://flags) (or [edge://flags](edge://flags)) page.
Search for **`#view-transition-on-navigation`** flag and **Disable** it.
Restart the browser.
Revert to the **Default** option after our patch arrives.

3. The next tip is for advanced users, **do at your own risk**.
- Click Dark Reader **icon**.
- Right-click somewhere in the popup and click **Inspect**.
- Switch to **Console** tab.
- Copy and paste the following script after the **>** symbol and press **Enter** (you may be asked to type **`allow pasting`**):
```js
chrome.storage.local.get({syncSettings:true},
t=>{var s=chrome.storage[t?'sync':'local'];
s.get(['theme'],x=>s.set({theme:{...x.theme,scrollbarColor:''}},
()=>chrome.runtime.reload()))})
```
- **Reload the affected tabs**.

4. If Google Search appears with its own dark theme,
activate **Dark Theme Detection** option in Dark Reader.
