## How to Use Dark Reader on a Mobile Phone

### Activating Dark Reader

- Click **â˜°** to open the **browser menu**.

- Click the ðŸ§© **Extensions** option.

- Click **Dark Reader** to open the extension's options.

- Make sure Dark Reader is turned on and activated for the current website.

### Changing color theme

- You can choose one of the pre-defined themes in the **Theme** section.

- Click the **Customize** button to access Theme Settings.

- Select a theme from one of the **pre-defined presets**, or choose **Create Your Theme** to design a custom look.

- Set custom background and text colors. 
**Hue** changes the color tone,
**Saturation** modifies the intensity of the color,
**Lightness** adjusts the brightness.

- **Filter** mode can be used for some web apps like spreadsheets or CAD editors. It works faster by inverting the web page's content, but will make already dark parts bright.

### Settings

- In the **General** settings, you can enable or disable the extension by default for all websites or PDF files.

- There are several **Automation** options.
Use **System Color Scheme** to activate the extension according to the systemâ€™s light or dark mode. You can also set **active hours** or turn the extension on after a **sunset** in a specific location (latitude and longitude).
